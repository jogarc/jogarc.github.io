            <b> About</b>
            <p> Welcome to the Delicious Desserts website!! My name is Joanne and I created this website because of my love for desserts.
                Although I may not be a connoisseur of desserts, 
                I very much appreciate these sweet tasting treats!!
                Ever since a young age, I've have always had a 
                sweet tooth for some reason. It didn't help that I 
                also tried to learn to bake from a young age as well.
                I remember starting off with the box mixes for brownies
                where all I had to add was an egg, water, and some oil. 
                Even though it was simple, I had so much fun and waited
                with anticipation until my product was finished. 
            </p>
            <p> Eventually, I advanced from the box sets and precut 
                cookies by trying out actual recipes from online. Trying 
                out recipes was one of the best decisions I made because 
                there can be so much more flavor and complexity from making 
                something from scratch rather than doing the box mix version
                of it. 
            </p>
            <p>Although I'm not the best baker, I had my ups and downs from
                trying out different recipes of different desserts. I wanted
                to make this website in order to share my experience as a baker
                in order to inspire others to try it out!
            </p>
