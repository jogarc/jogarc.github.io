        <p>I think Tasty is a very good resource for starting out. The website is 
            very popular because of their Youtube videos that show the process
            of cooking various kinds of foods. They market towards an audience
            who are not that well-versed in cooking by showing recipes that can be
            easy to make or do not require a lot of fancy ingredients or equipment.

        <p>For me, I think the New York Times Cooking has a solid reputation when it comes
            to their recipes. In fact, the Vanilla Creme Brulee recipe for this week
            comes from a recipe from the New York Times Cooking. This website has both recipes
            for beginning and advanced bakers. Being a college student, it's hard to get 
            all of the high quality ingredients or the equipment that some of these recipes ask 
            for. Therefore, I think that finding recipes here can sometimes be a hit or miss. </p>
